# Munder Difflin

**Local multi-agent harness for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code).**
Autonomous agents that message, route, and remember — coordinated by a **GOD** orchestrator
you talk to, and visualized as avatars at work on a shared office floor.

---

> [!NOTE]
> **The world's best agents. The world's worst paper company.**
> Munder Difflin takes the `claude` CLI sessions you already run in your terminal and turns them
> into a self-coordinating team: each agent gets long-term memory, a mailbox, and a desk on a 2D
> office floor — and a **GOD orchestrator agent** routes work between them while you watch.

## What it is

Munder Difflin is a desktop app that wraps **real Claude Code terminals** as fully-capable agents,
wires them into a **hive mind**, and puts a **GOD orchestration agent** in charge — the one agent
*you* talk to in order to get things done. Under the hood it runs the **fastest memory layer in the
world** so every agent remembers what it learns and recalls it instantly.

- **Every terminal is an agent.** Each `claude` session runs as a real process in a pseudo-terminal
  (`node-pty`), byte-for-byte authentic, rendered with xterm.js.
- **Every agent is an avatar.** Sessions appear as characters on a Pixi.js office floor — they walk
  to stations as they work, and envelopes fly desk-to-desk when they message each other.
- **The hive coordinates them.** Agents read their memory and drain a mailbox; the router moves
  messages between inboxes; the GOD agent adjudicates, assigns, and escalates only when it needs you.
- **Memory that's instant.** A markdown-first memory layer with a semantic recall index means agents
  remember across sessions and recall in milliseconds.

## How it works

```

1. **You spawn agents** — each is a normal `claude` process with its own working directory,
   identity, and hook lifecycle.
2. **Agents collaborate through the hive** — a local git repo of plain files. They write to their own
   `outbox/`; the harness's router delivers into recipients' `inbox/`. No agent ever touches git
   (single-committer design avoids `index.lock` corruption).
3. **The GOD agent runs the floor** — it reads every request, resolves routine ones itself (keeping
   the system fully autonomous), and only escalates *critical* items (spend, destructive ops, scope
   changes) into an approvals queue you act on.
4. **Everything is visible** — you watch avatars move, envelopes fly, and the live terminal stream;
   you can type back into any session, browse its files, and read its git history.

See [`HIVE.md`](./HIVE.md) for the full multi-agent design, [`SPEC.md`](./SPEC.md) for the
terminal/event plane, and [`DESIGN.md`](./DESIGN.md) for the visual system.

## Features

| Area | What works today |
|---|---|
| **Real terminals** | Spawn Claude Code, Codex, or a custom command in a `node-pty` PTY. Full read/write/resize/kill, live streaming over IPC, multi-agent. |
| **The hive** | On-disk multi-agent layer: per-agent identity + long-term memory, atomic-file mailboxes, a shared blackboard, append-only event log, single-committer git. |
| **GOD orchestrator** | An always-on supervisor agent that adjudicates traffic, routes tasks, scribes the blackboard, and escalates only critical items to you. |
| **Memory layer** | Markdown-first long-term memory per agent, mined into a shared semantic palace for instant recall; searchable from the UI. Degrades gracefully when the index isn't installed. |
| **Office floor** | Pixi.js scene with a Tiled office map, camera, recolored cast, pathfinding, seat assignment, and tool-bubble overlays. |
| **Message handoffs** | When the hive routes a message, an envelope flies from sender to recipient (tinted by speech-act; escalations fly to the door) and pops an arrival sparkle. |
| **Per-agent panel** | Live terminal, command bar to type back, fullscreen terminal, sandboxed file browser + CodeMirror editor, and a git tab (status, log, commit graph, branches). |
| **Approvals & memory panels** | Human-in-the-loop approval queue for escalations; a memory search panel over the shared palace. |
| **Onboarding wizard** | First-run setup: harness home, registered repos, default command, auto-mode. |
| **Design system** | Fully tokenized SNES / Animal-Crossing aesthetic — pixel panels, buttons, badges, hand-drawn icons. See [`DESIGN.md`](./DESIGN.md). |
| **Command Center** | Michael's control surface, overhauled in v0.2.0: Terminal, Floor (roster + dispatch + per-agent model selector + live fleet monitoring), Memory (MemPalace + text search + memory graph), Activity (log + board + real token telemetry + observability + CI watcher), Tasks (kanban board with dependencies + status tracking), Schedules (recurring missions + heartbeat). |
| **Per-agent git worktrees** | 'Git isolation' toggle in Add Agent auto-provisions a dedicated worktree per agent on spawn and tears it down on kill — agents never collide on branches. |
| **Token & cost telemetry** | Activity tab reads `~/.claude/projects/` JSONL transcripts and surfaces real token counts + estimated USD cost per agent per session, backed by a durable cost ledger that survives restarts. |
| **Per-agent token budgets** | Set a token budget per agent and watch live fleet monitoring track consumption across the whole roster — paired with the cost/runaway circuit breaker to keep spend in check. |
| **Observability** | Live OpenTelemetry collector with per-model cost attribution, a fleet grid, and a per-agent tool-span waterfall — see exactly what every agent is doing and what it costs, in real time. |
| **Context-window gauge** | Each agent card's progress bar is a context-window gauge — see how much of the model's context each agent has consumed at a glance. |
| **Circuit breaker** | A cost/runaway guard with a steer → constrain → stop ladder: the breaker nudges, then constrains, then stops agents that loop, storm errors, or blow their budget. |
| **HITL gate & mid-run control** | Human-in-the-loop gate, mid-run steer, and graceful stop — all driven through Claude Code hook returns, so you can intervene without killing the session. |
| **Durable persistence** | SQLite-backed durable store keeps window bounds + history across restarts, alongside the durable cost ledger and persisted session IDs. |
| **MemoryReflector** | Memory condensation that summarizes and bounds per-agent memory over time, so long-term memory doesn't grow without limit. |
| **Configurable home folder** | Point the hive/memory home at any folder, with a safe move that relocates existing state without losing it. |
| **Restore team** | One-click "Restore team" rebuilds last session's workers after a harness restart — no more re-adding agents by hand. |
| **Task kanban** | Dependency-aware kanban board in the Command Center Tasks tab — assign tasks to agents, track status across todo/doing/blocked/done, wire dependencies so work starts in order. |
| **Scheduled missions & heartbeat** | Recurring auto-dispatch missions with label, interval, target agent, and body — plus a scheduler heartbeat that re-engages the floor when it goes quiet. Delete scheduled missions inline, and see last/next-fired times in the Schedules tab. |
| **GitHub ingestion** | Pull open issues from any registered repo via the `gh` CLI and assign them to agents with one click from the Command Center. |
| **CI status watcher** | Live pass/fail/in-progress status for GitHub Actions runs, visible in the Activity tab for every registered repo. |
| **Threaded chat** | Every hive message is grouped by conversation and rendered as a reply chain in each agent's Messages tab — readable, replyable, auditable. |
| **Desktop notifications** | Native OS notifications when an agent finishes a task or is waiting for your input. |
| **Agent archival** | Closing an agent tab archives it (memory + history preserved) rather than destroying it. |
| **Avatar states** | Avatars reflect real work — including new v0.2.0 states for *compacting* (context compaction) and *looping* (circuit-breaker intervention), on top of crisper HiDPI floor text and high-contrast speech bubbles. |

> [!NOTE]
> **Status: v0.2.0 — observability, control, and durability.** This release brings a Command Center overhaul, per-agent token budgets with live fleet monitoring, full observability (live OpenTelemetry collector, per-model cost, fleet grid + per-agent tool-span waterfall), an agent-card context-window gauge, a cost/runaway circuit breaker (steer → constrain → stop) with a scheduler heartbeat, a human-in-the-loop gate plus mid-run steer and graceful stop via hook returns, SQLite-backed durable persistence (window bounds + history) and a durable cost ledger, the MemoryReflector for memory condensation, a configurable hive/memory home folder with safe move, one-click "Restore team" after restart, a delete button for scheduled missions, new *compacting* and *looping* avatar states, terminal legibility/contrast + HiDPI fixes, and a Windows fix to keep the hive alive behind the lock screen. All of v0.1.x — the hook plane, office floor, hive coordination, git isolation, token telemetry, task kanban, scheduled missions, GitHub/CI integration, threaded conversations, desktop notifications, agent archival, a Slack→queue bridge, and native human-in-the-loop approvals — remains functional and shipping. macOS (signed), Windows, and Linux builds are available on the releases page.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- **macOS** (macOS-first; Windows/Linux untested).
- **Node.js 18+** and npm.
- A **C/C++ toolchain** for `node-pty`'s native addon — on macOS, install Xcode Command Line Tools:
  ```bash
  xcode-select --install
  ```
- **[Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)** on your `PATH` so agents can run `claude`
  (the default command). Add Agent also includes a Codex preset that runs `codex`
  without Claude-only flags; initial Codex support is terminal spawning with shared
  workspace/env, not Claude telemetry, hook parity, or hive inbox delivery (direct
  hive mail to Codex/custom agents bounces to the god agent).
- *Optional:* the semantic memory index for instant cross-session recall (the app works without it —
  markdown memory still functions).

### RealPage corporate network setup

On the RealPage network, Palo Alto Prisma performs TLS inspection and presents a
**RealPage-signed certificate** for outbound HTTPS. Node and npm don't trust that
CA out of the box, so `npm install` fails in `postinstall` with
`SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN` when `node-gyp`/`electron-rebuild` and the `electron`
package try to download native build headers and the Electron runtime. Do this
**once per machine** before installing:

```bash
# 1. Export the RealPage CA chain from the macOS keychain into a PEM file.
CA="$HOME/.realpage-ca.pem"
security find-certificate -a -p -c "RealPage" /Library/Keychains/System.keychain > "$CA"
security find-certificate -a -p -c "RealPage" /System/Library/Keychains/SystemRootCertificates.keychain >> "$CA"

# 2. Point npm at it (persists in ~/.npmrc).
npm config set cafile "$CA"

# 3. Point Node itself at it, for downloads that don't read npm's config
#    (e.g. the Electron runtime). Add to ~/.zshrc so it sticks.
echo 'export NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS="$HOME/.realpage-ca.pem"' >> ~/.zshrc
export NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS="$HOME/.realpage-ca.pem"
```

Do **not** use `npm config set strict-ssl false` — trusting the corporate CA is
the correct, scoped fix.

> **Node 24 note:** the `electron` installer unpacks its runtime with a library
> that silently truncates the extract on Node 24, leaving an unlaunchable app
> ("Electron uninstall"). This repo's `postinstall` runs `tools/ensure-electron.cjs`,
> which detects the broken extract and re-unpacks the runtime with the OS `unzip`
> automatically — no action needed. It's a no-op on Node versions where the bug
> isn't present.

> **Tip:** clone to a plain local path (e.g. `~/Code`), not a cloud-synced folder
> like OneDrive — background sync can lock or de-hydrate `node_modules` files mid-build.

### Install & run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/realpage-cole/rp-agent-harness.git
cd rp-agent-harness
npm install        # postinstall rebuilds node-pty + heals the Electron runtime extract
npm run dev        # launches the Electron app with hot reload
```

On first launch you'll go through the onboarding wizard, then land on the floor. Use **Add agent** to
spawn your first session — the GOD agent seats itself in Michael's office automatically.

### Other scripts

```bash
npm run build      # production build via electron-vite
npm run preview    # preview the production build
npm run typecheck  # type-check the node (main/preload) and web (renderer) projects
```

> If `node-pty` fails to load after an Electron upgrade, re-run `npm install` (the `postinstall` hook
> runs `electron-rebuild` against the current Electron ABI).

## Architecture

Two data planes feed one renderer:

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

└─────────────┼──────────────────────────┼───────────────────────┘
              │ IPC (contextBridge: window.cth)
       ┌──────┴──────────┐        ┌──────┴─────────────┐
       │  Event Plane    │        │  Terminal Plane    │
       │  hooks / hive   │        │  node-pty PTYs     │
       │  router + GOD   │        │  + fs + git        │
       └────────▲────────┘        └──────▲─────────────┘
                │ hook payloads          │ stdin / stdout
                └─────────┬──────────────┘
                   ┌──────┴──────────────┐
                   │  claude (or any cmd)│
                   └─────────────────────┘
```

- **Terminal plane.** The main process owns a `PtyManager` that spawns each agent as a `node-pty`
  process and streams output over per-id IPC (`pty:data:<id>`). The renderer talks only through a
  typed `window.cth` bridge ([`src/preload/index.ts`](./src/preload/index.ts)), which also exposes
  sandboxed filesystem and git helpers.
- **Hive / event plane.** `hive.ts` is the on-disk multi-agent layer; `hooks.ts` runs a Unix-socket
  server that the per-agent `cth-hook` shim POSTs Claude Code hook payloads to (`PreToolUse`,
  `PostToolUse`, `Stop`, …); `memory.ts` wraps the semantic memory CLI. The router delivers messages,
  the GOD agent adjudicates, and a `Stop`-loop keeps idle agents draining their inboxes.

## Design system

The aesthetic is **Animal Crossing × Earthbound × SNES menu UI** — pixel-snapped, chunky, friendly.
[`DESIGN.md`](./DESIGN.md) is canonical; every component derives from its tokens. The Munder Difflin
brand layers a **Dunder-Mifflin maroon** (`#6E1423`) and **gold** (`#F4D35E`) on top for logo and
chrome. The 15 avatars are the cast of *The Office*, differentiated by hair/skin/shirt recipes.

## Roadmap

Shipped in **v0.2.0**:

- [x] **Heartbeat** — scheduler heartbeat that re-engages the floor when it goes quiet, with last/next-fired times surfaced in the Schedules tab.
- [x] **Memory reflection** — the MemoryReflector summarizes and bounds per-agent memory over time to prevent unbounded growth.
- [x] **Persistence** — SQLite-backed durable store for window bounds + history across restarts, plus a durable cost ledger and persisted session IDs.
- [x] **Hook-driven avatars** — broadened hook→station coverage and caged the synthetic demo loop, with new *compacting* and *looping* avatar states.

Next up:

- [ ] **Chat integrations** — Slack and Telegram bridges that pipe a channel straight into Michael's queue (and route his replies back out), so you can run the floor from your phone.
- [ ] **Pluggable agent CLIs** — run the harness over coding-agent CLIs beyond Claude Code: Claw Code, opencode, and Codex CLI.
- [ ] **Realtime Michael** — a low-latency realtime LLM channel for quick, snappy back-and-forth with the orchestrator, alongside the async terminal.
- [ ] **Fuller avatar coverage** — push the remaining station visits and tool-bubbles to be driven 100% by real Claude Code hook events.
- [ ] **Durable layout & command history** — extend persistence to agent layout and per-session command history.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome — this is an early prototype with a lot of surface area. Start with
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md). The short version: fork, `npm install && npm run dev`, keep
`npm run typecheck` green, and **derive any new UI from [`DESIGN.md`](./DESIGN.md) tokens**. Good
first areas: wiring real hook events, the add-agent flow, the config drawer, and cross-platform work.
