# Munder Difflin v0.1.9

**A local hive of Claude Code agents that run themselves** — messaging, routing, and
remembering, coordinated by a GOD orchestrator you talk to. Local-first and open source.

## What's new in 0.1.9
- **Hourly ops standup** — a built-in scheduled mission where the GOD orchestrator reviews who's doing what and whether work is on track, and **compacts every terminal's context** each hour to keep agents lean. On by default; toggle it in the Command Center.
- **Fixed: agents quitting on their own at a "Bypass Permissions" prompt** — on a fresh machine, agents hit a one-time interactive warning the terminal couldn't answer and exited within seconds. The harness now pre-accepts Claude Code's dangerous-mode warning before spawn.
- **Windows fixes** — the hook server now uses a named pipe, and `mempalace` (semantic memory) is detected on Windows. POSIX behavior unchanged. (Thanks @Xileck)
- **Palace mining hardened** — mining is serialized to avoid "palace is held by PID …" writer-lock collisions (thanks @Xileck), and a per-agent `.gitignore` keeps config/message noise out of the semantic index.
- **Blog cards** — thumbnail tiles are no longer flush against the card border.

## First launch

- **macOS** — the build is **signed with a Developer ID** (hardened runtime). If macOS
  still shows an "unidentified developer" warning on first open, right-click the app →
  **Open** → **Open** once. After that, the first time agents touch a folder you'll get a
  single macOS privacy prompt for Documents/Desktop/Downloads — allow it once and the
  grant sticks (it covers the `claude` agents the app spawns), because the grant is bound
  to the app's stable signature.
- **Windows** — not code-signed yet; SmartScreen may show "Windows protected your PC" →
  **More info** → **Run anyway**.
- **Linux** — make the AppImage executable: `chmod +x Munder-Difflin-*.AppImage`, then run it.

---

## Requirements
- macOS 12+, Windows 10/11, or a modern Linux desktop
- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) installed and on your `PATH`
- A Claude Code subscription (Munder Difflin drives your existing `claude` CLI — it doesn't replace it)

---

## 🛠 Build from source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chaitanyagiri/munder-difflin.git
cd munder-difflin
npm install        # rebuilds node-pty for Electron
npm run dev        # launches the app with hot reload
```
Node 18+ and a C/C++ toolchain are required (Xcode CLT on macOS, Build Tools on Windows).
To produce installers yourself: `npm run dist` (current OS), or `dist:mac` / `dist:win` / `dist:linux`.

---

## What's inside
- **The simulation** — every agent is a real `claude` pseudo-terminal, visualized as an avatar on a watchable office floor (`node-pty` · `xterm.js` · Pixi.js).
- **MemPalace** — a markdown-first, semantic memory layer the whole office shares; cross-session recall in ~12ms.
- **GOD orchestrator + hive** — one agent you talk to routes work to specialists and stays autonomous, escalating only critical items (spend, destructive ops, scope) to an approvals queue.
- **Plugs into your setup** — your subscription, settings, skills, and MCP servers; `/remote-control` reaches the whole floor from your phone.
