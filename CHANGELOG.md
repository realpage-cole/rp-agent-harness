## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.2] — 2026-06-07

A community polish release — almost entirely the work of @Gulum: a live context-window
gauge on every agent card, sharper terminals, correct Windows metering, and dispatch that
always routes through the god.

### Added
- **Live context-window gauge on each agent card.** A Claude Code statusLine pushes the session's exact token count and real context-window size after every response, so each agent card shows a precise live fuel gauge drawn from Claude Code itself instead of a transcript estimate. The gauge also zeroes the instant you send `/clear`, rather than briefly showing the previous session's full bar until the next response. (Thanks @Gulum — #12, closes #11.)
- **Per-session terminal theme toggle + Unicode 11 emoji widths.** Each terminal session can now switch its Claude theme independently, and emoji column widths follow Unicode 11 so wide glyphs stop nudging the cursor out of alignment. (The WebGL renderer, copy/paste, and `minimumContrastRatio` from v0.2.0 are kept as-is.) (Thanks @Gulum — #26.)
- **All human dispatch flows through the god.** Every Command Center dispatch now mails the god (`Task from the human`) instead of writing straight into a worker's inbox; the worker dropdown becomes a **suggested owner** (Michael still decides), so nothing skips the orchestrator. (Thanks @Gulum — #45, fixes #44.)
- **Dedicated context-window row on the monitor tab.** The Floor monitor's cumulative budget bar was being misread as a per-agent context gauge; a separate `ctx` context-window row now sits alongside it, so the live context window and the cumulative budget aren't confused. (Thanks @Gulum — #46.)

### Fixed
- **Windows usage meter no longer reads 0/0.** The transcript reconciler built the per-project directory name with the POSIX rule, but Claude Code on Windows encodes *every* non-alphanumeric character (including the drive colon), so the meter never found the transcript and always read 0 tokens / $0.00. (Thanks @Gulum — #34, fixes #10.)
- **Send-only assistant mail no longer black-holes.** Direct mail to the send-only prep assistant landed in an inbox nothing reads; the router now bounces it to the god (subject prefixed `[bounced …]`) instead of dropping it. (Thanks @Gulum — #33, fixes #32.)
- **Boot banner no longer stacks in scrollback.** `tryFit()` fired `resizePty` on every fit even when the dimensions were unchanged; redundant resizes are now skipped, so the boot banner stops re-stacking in the terminal history. (Thanks @Gulum — #8.)
- **Visible text-select cursor on the cream theme.** The hovering I-beam (an OS cursor that CSS color hints can't touch, drawn white by several Windows schemes) is now an inked I-beam with a halo, so it stays visible over the light terminal. (Thanks @Gulum — #39.)

## [0.2.1] — 2026-06-07

A small follow-up to v0.2.0 that makes the scheduler considerate of agents that are mid-task.

### Changed
- **Scheduled auto-compaction is queued, not forced.** The hourly ops-standup's terminal compaction is now enqueued per agent and delivered only when that agent is idle (deduped — at most one `/compact` pending at a time), so it compacts *between* steps instead of jamming a working terminal mid-step. The standup prompt now asks each agent to summarise its current task and next step, then resume from the same point after compacting.
- **Heartbeat is inbox-driven.** The floor heartbeat (`reengageGod`) no longer types directly into Michael's terminal; it drops its digest in his inbox, which the busy-aware inbox-wake delivers once he's idle.

### Docs
- Expanded the README roadmap (chat integrations, pluggable agent CLIs, realtime Michael).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-07

The observability and control release. v0.2.0 makes the fleet visible and keeps it in check — and it's a community release in the most literal sense: most of the work below came from external contributors. Huge thanks to everyone credited.

### Added
- **Command Center overhaul.** Michael's control surface was reworked into the place you actually run the floor from — the roster, dispatch, schedules, memory, and activity views now carry the new live signals (token budgets, telemetry, breaker state) without becoming a wall of numbers.
- **Per-agent token budgets + live fleet monitoring.** Every agent carries a token budget, and the floor monitors consumption live so a single agent can't quietly run the bill up.
- **Live OTel telemetry collector + per-model cost.** A built-in OpenTelemetry collector and a `UsageProvider` seam feed real usage in, with per-model cost attribution (interim transcript-backed stub behind the seam to start).
- **Fleet grid + per-agent tool-span waterfall.** A live grid of the whole fleet, plus a per-agent tool-span waterfall that shows what an agent spent its turn doing — which tool calls ran, in what order, for how long.
- **Agent-card context-window gauge.** The agent card's progress bar is repurposed into a context-window gauge so you can see at a glance how close each agent is to filling its context. (Thanks @Gulum — #12.)
- **Circuit breaker.** A steer → constrain → stop ladder plus a cost/runaway guard, fed by hook signals (repeated identical tool calls), an `onApiError` seam for error-storm trips, and budget config.
- **Scheduler heartbeat.** A heartbeat beat tracks each agent's last output (quiet/idle signals), enforces circuit-breaker policy, and adds spawn guardrails; the SCHEDULES view shows the heartbeat row plus last-fired / next-fired times. (Thanks @albozes — #2.)
- **Human-in-the-loop, mid-run.** A HITL gate, mid-run steer, and graceful stop all delivered through hook returns — approve, redirect, or cleanly halt an agent mid-turn instead of yanking it.
- **Durable SQLite persistence (Phase A).** A SQLite durable store persists window bounds and history, alongside a persisted `session_id` and a durable cost ledger (`cost-ledger.jsonl`) so cost and provenance survive restarts.
- **MemoryReflector — memory condensation.** The janitor's missing condense half: a reflector that condenses memory instead of only mining it, keeping the semantic store lean.
- **Configurable hive/memory home folder.** Point the hive and memory home at a folder of your choosing, with a safe move that relocates existing data.
- **One-click "Restore team."** After a harness restart, a single click brings back the last session's workers — no more re-adding agents one by one. (Thanks @Gulum — #16.)
- **Delete scheduled missions.** Scheduled missions now have a delete button. (Thanks @Gulum — #9.)
- **New avatar states.** A compacting state (on `PreCompact`) and a looping state (when the breaker engages) so the floor reflects what the control layer is doing.

### Fixed
- **Terminal contrast + HiDPI legibility.** A `minimumContrastRatio` floor and a tuned light palette (including dual fg/bg-legible green/yellow) keep text legible on coloured backgrounds across both the new and legacy terminal views.
- **Crisp, readable floor text.** A HiDPI canvas, bold bubbles, and a walk-flicker fix sharpen office-floor text; thought-cloud text now stays 1:1 when the window shrinks. (Thanks @Gulum — #20.)
- **Terminal no longer jumps to the top of history on first scroll**, and the viewport dead zone is gone (re-sync routed through xterm, not the DOM). (Thanks @Gulum — #8.)
- **Windows: keep the hive running behind the lock screen.** The hive no longer freezes when Windows locks — keep-awake plus no throttling. (Thanks @Gulum — #18.)
- **Live agent statuses** and **composer-draft fixes** for the message-queue composer. (Thanks @Gulum — #7, #27, #28.)
- **Palace writer-lock serialization** and **Windows named-pipe + mempalace detection** so the hook server and semantic memory work on Windows. (Thanks @Xileck.)
- **Per-PTY input serialization** so the boot sequence can't jam mid-spawn; restored `+x` on the `node-pty` spawn-helper so agents can spawn.
- **GOD orchestration tabs** are now scrollable; the title-bar settings button is a clear gear chip.
- **Global `defaultModel` wins over role tier** (an explicit per-agent pick still wins); cost-ledger row is fully snake_case for a 1:1 SQLite migration (#4).

## [0.1.9] — 2026-06-06

### Added
- **Hourly ops standup.** A built-in scheduled mission (enabled by default) where the GOD orchestrator reviews every agent — who's doing what, whether tasks are on track, and whether agents are still running — and **compacts each terminal's context** on the same hourly cadence to keep agents lean. Toggle it in the Command Center; a one-time migration seeds it into existing installs (and won't re-add it once deleted).

### Fixed
- **Agents exited on their own at a "Bypass Permissions mode" prompt.** Agents spawn with `--permission-mode bypassPermissions`, which on a fresh machine shows a one-time interactive "WARNING: Bypass Permissions mode … 1. No, exit / 2. Yes, I accept" prompt the terminal couldn't answer, so the agent exited code 1 within seconds. The harness now idempotently pre-accepts Claude Code's dangerous-mode warning (`skipDangerousModePermissionPrompt` / `skipAutoPermissionPrompt`) and per-folder trust before each spawn.
- **Blog cards.** The colored thumbnail tile sat flush against each card's bold border; it's now inset with padding for breathing room (desktop + mobile).
- **Windows: hook server + semantic memory.** The hook server now binds a named pipe on Windows (where Node IPC isn't a filesystem socket), and `mempalace` is detected via `where` + the standard `.exe` install locations so semantic memory works on Windows. POSIX behavior unchanged. (Thanks @Xileck — #4.)
- **Palace mining writer-lock collisions.** Mining is now serialized — a single writer at a time with a re-entrancy guard — fixing "palace is held by PID …" failures when multiple agents mined concurrently. (Thanks @Xileck — #5.)
- **MemPalace index noise.** Each agent's `.gitignore` is ensured before mining so `settings.json`, the cursor file, and raw inbox/outbox message JSON stay out of the semantic index — keeping recall and wake-up focused on real memory.

## [0.1.8] — 2026-06-05

### Fixed
- **Windows agent spawn.** Launching an agent on Windows failed with `cannot create process, error code: 2` (ENOENT) because binary and PATH resolution were Unix-only (`SHELL`/`/bin/zsh`, `-ilc`, `which`, and Unix-only fallback paths). Windows now resolves `claude` via `where`, checks the standard Windows install locations (`%APPDATA%\npm\claude.cmd`, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\claude`, `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\local`), uses the process `PATH` directly (no login-shell probe), and recognizes Windows-style (`\`) absolute paths. macOS and Linux resolution is unchanged; the Unix fallbacks now also include `~/.volta/bin`.

## [0.1.7] — 2026-06-04

### Added
- **Slack → Michael's queue.** A new Slack integration (Settings → Slack) pipes a channel's messages straight into Michael's message queue — paste a message in Slack and it lands in his queue exactly as if you'd typed it. Off by default; every request is verified with your Slack signing secret (HMAC + 5-minute replay guard) before it's accepted, and a localtunnel exposes the local webhook for Slack's Event Subscriptions.

### Changed
- **Approvals are now native.** The in-app approvals queue/panel is removed in favor of native Claude Code human-in-the-loop prompts. A `to:"human"` decision now reaches you through Michael's session and native permission prompts — approvable from your phone via `/remote-control` — and Michael boots straight into running the floor.

### Fixed
- The floating approvals panel could re-queue an item when you approved it (`resolveApproval` re-routed the message back into the queue). Moving to native HITL removes the panel and the bug.

## [0.1.6] — 2026-06-04

### Added
- **Per-agent git worktrees.** A 'Git isolation' toggle in Add Agent auto-provisions a dedicated worktree (`<harnessHome>/worktrees/<agentId>/`) on spawn and tears it down on kill. Agents on the same repo never collide on branches.
- **Task kanban with dependencies.** A Tasks tab in the Command Center renders a full kanban board (todo / doing / blocked / done). Each task carries an assignee, a `dependsOn[]` list, priority, and description — and persists in `hive/tasks.json` via a new `hive:writeTasks` IPC channel.
- **Scheduled missions.** A Schedules section in the Floor tab lets you define recurring auto-dispatch missions (label, interval, target agent, body). The main process fires each on a `setInterval`, stamps `lastFiredAt`, and persists the list in config.
- **Real token & cost telemetry.** The Activity tab reads `~/.claude/projects/` JSONL transcripts — the same files Claude Code writes — and displays actual input/output/cache token counts and estimated USD cost per agent per model. No more proxy tool-call counts.
- **Global hive text search.** Full-text search across `board.md`, `tasks.json`, and all agent `memory.md` files, available in the Memory tab alongside MemPalace semantic search.
- **Threaded chat.** A Messages tab in each agent's sidebar renders every hive message grouped by conversation with full reply chains and an inline reply form.
- **Memory graph.** A visual graph in the Command Center Memory tab maps agents and their knowledge relationships.
- **GitHub issue ingestion.** An Issues section in the Floor tab pulls open issues from any registered repo via `gh issue list` and lets you assign them to any agent with one click.
- **CI status watcher.** A CI Status section in the Activity tab polls `gh run list` for every registered repo and shows live pass/fail/in-progress status for GitHub Actions runs.
- **Desktop notifications.** Native OS notifications fire when an agent finishes a task or is waiting for your input. Toggle in Settings.
- **Agent archival.** Closing an agent's tab archives it (memory + history intact) rather than deleting it permanently.

### Fixed
- Scheduler now honors `lastFiredAt` on config reload — missions don't double-fire after a save.
- PTY lifecycle teardown runs on natural process exit as well as explicit kill, so worktrees are cleaned up reliably.
- Task IDs fall back to a stable UUID when the title is empty; `writeTasks` IPC validates its input.

## [0.1.5] — 2026-06-04

### Added
- **Dwight, Michael's prep assistant.** A persistent, visible assistant agent
  (Sonnet, 1M context) spawns on startup. A global **enrich** toggle routes
  Michael's queued prompts through Dwight first — he gathers repo context and
  rewrites the prompt, then forwards it to Michael through the hive; toggle it off
  and prompts go straight to Michael.
- **Michael's Command Center.** His sidebar becomes a control surface with
  Terminal, Floor (agent roster + **per-agent model selector** with safe restart,
  a dispatch box, and working dirs), Memory (MemPalace search + per-agent memory),
  and Activity (live log feed + board + usage proxy), plus a copyable Claude
  command handbook.
- **Per-agent model selection** — a model picker in **Add Agent**, a shared model
  list, and a message-queue composer with the enrich toggle.
- **Getting-started tutorial** on the blog (canonical install + first-run walkthrough),
  with Blog/tutorial CTAs and a redesigned "How it works" section on the landing page.

### Fixed
- Agents no longer read **"idle" while still working** — a Stop blocked mid-turn now
  reports `blocked` so the UI keeps the agent in its working state.
- Long agent thought/tool labels now **word-wrap inside their cards** instead of
  overflowing the bubble horizontally (Pixi word-wrap with a raw-length cap so a
  pathological string can't grow a runaway-tall card).
- Switching agent terminals now lands at the **latest output**, while resizes
  preserve scroll position; the idle action label no longer echoes the "idle" badge.

## [0.1.4] — 2026-06-04

### Added
- **Signed macOS builds.** The app now ships with a hardened-runtime Developer ID
  signature (notarization is attempted in CI and stapled when it succeeds; the build is
  best-effort, so a notarization hiccup never blocks a release). Because macOS binds a
  folder-access (TCC) grant to a stable code signature, you're now prompted for
  Documents/Desktop/Downloads access **once** instead of on every agent action.
  Usage-description strings explain each prompt. Signing/notarization run in CI only
  when Apple credentials are present, so contributor builds stay unsigned and green.
- **Blog at [/blog](https://munderdiffl.in/blog/)** — an Eleventy-generated static blog
  sharing the landing page's neo-brutalist design system, seeded with the first posts
  on long-term memory, multi-agent harnesses, and MemPalace, plus tag/topic indexes and
  an RSS feed.
- **On-site SEO/AEO metadata** — JSON-LD, `robots.txt`, a root `sitemap.xml`, and richer
  link-unfurl/meta tags across the site.

## [0.1.3] — 2026-06-01

### Added
- **Settings panel** (title-bar gear) with a **Reset & start over** action that wipes
  Michael's memories, the entire hive (every agent, message, task, and the board), and
  the semantic-memory palace, then relaunches the app into onboarding.
- Boot loader ("clocking in") shown while the GOD agent initializes, so returning users
  no longer see the empty "add agent" screen during startup.

### Fixed
- Crash dialog on quit caused by sending IPC to an already-destroyed window during
  teardown; all renderer sends are now destroyed-safe and shutdown steps are best-effort.
- Michael no longer marches to the door flagged "needs you" right after finishing a turn —
  idle "waiting for input" notifications now let him linger at his desk instead of
  escalating as a blocked/needs-action state.

## [Brand & rename]

### Added
- Brand identity: **Munder Difflin** — logo (`docs/logo.svg`), square mark
  (`docs/logo-mark.svg`), and hero banner (`docs/banner.svg`).
- Landing page at `docs/index.html` (GitHub Pages–ready).
- In-app branding: window title, boot screen, title-bar `MD` badge, and fullscreen
  header captions.
- Open-source community files: `SECURITY.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, issue/PR templates, and a
  CI workflow.

### Changed
- Renamed the project from *Claude Terminal Harness* to **Munder Difflin** across the
  README, docs (`SPEC.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `HIVE.md`), `package.json`, and the app UI.

## [0.1.0] — 2026

Initial working prototype.

### Added
- Electron + React + TypeScript shell (electron-vite).
- Real terminals via `node-pty`, rendered with xterm.js; multi-agent spawn/write/
  resize/kill over typed IPC (`window.cth`).
- Pixi.js office floor: Tiled map, camera, recolored cast, pathfinding, seat assignment,
  tool bubbles, and message envelopes.
- The hive: on-disk multi-agent layer (`hive.ts`), hook server + `cth-hook` shim and
  `Stop`-loop (`hooks.ts`), and a semantic memory layer (`memory.ts`).
- GOD orchestrator agent, approvals queue, and memory search panel.
- Sandboxed file browser + CodeMirror editor and a git tab (status, log, branches,
  commit graph).
- Onboarding wizard, safe-quit guard, and a tokenized SNES/Animal-Crossing design
  system.
